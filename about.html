      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        Hey, I’m <strong>Cameron Rogers</strong>, a software developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm passionate about building meaningful digital experiences and constantly expanding my skills in the evolving tech space.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I was born and raised in Macon, Georgia, where my curiosity for technology started early. Growing up, I was the kind of kid who always asked how things worked — and that mindset naturally drew me to programming and engineering.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I currently finished my degree in Information Technology at Middle Georgia State University, with a concentration in Software Engineering. Throughout my academic tenure, I’ve built hands-on projects ranging from Raspberry Pi robotics to full-stack web apps, and I’ve learned to approach problem-solving with both logic and creativity.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        My journey has taught me the value of resilience, adaptability, and staying curious. I’m excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute to projects that make an impact.
